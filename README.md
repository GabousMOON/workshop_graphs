# UVU Math Graph

## What is Math Graph?
Math Graph is a collection of interactive graphs that will help students visualize all sorts of mathematical functions and their various transformations. 

## Use
If you want to use this all you have to do is open up the html file in your web browser. It should be functional in most web browsers. Dont use internet explorer because duh, but I've tested the bokeh library in Chrome, Edge and Opera and it worked there. Send me a message if you have any suggestions.
